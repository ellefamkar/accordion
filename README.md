## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- react
- react hooks
- vite
- mobile-first workflow

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the project. So if you got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a try.

### What I learned

This projects helped me being more confident with the details of react components, hooks and react mindset to create a responsive Note App with.

To see parts of my codes and see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```Jsx

function AccordionOpen() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(null);

  return (
    <div className="accordion one-open-accordion">
      {data.map((item) => (
        <AccordionItem
          key={item.id}
          id={item.id}
          title={item.title}
          open={open}
        >
          {item.content}
        </AccordionItem>
      ))}
      <AccordionItem
        id={0}
        title={"Last Accordion"}
        setOpen={setOpen}
        open={open}
      >
        <p>Text for the dynamic accordion</p>
      </AccordionItem>
    </div>
  );
}

export default AccordionOpen;

function AccordionItem({ id, title, setOpen, open, children }) {
  const isOpen = id === open;

  return (
    <div className={`accordion-item ${isOpen ? "accordion__expanded" : ""}`}>
      <div
        className="accordion-item__header"
        onClick={() => setOpen(isOpen ? null : id)}
      >
        {title}
        <ChevronDownIcon className="accordion-item__chevron" />
      </div>
      <div className="accordion-item__content">{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
}


```

```css
.accordion-item__content {
  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
  max-height: 0px;
  opacity: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  color: #374151;
  font-size: 1.1rem;
  line-height: 1.6;
  padding: 0 1rem;
}

.accordion-item.accordion__expanded .accordion-item__content {
  padding: 1rem;
  opacity: 1;
  max-height: 100vh;
  transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

.accordion-item__chevron {
  width: 1.2rem;
  height: 1.2rem;
  transition: all 0.3s ease-out;
  rotate: 0deg;
}
```

### Continued development

In my future projects, not only i am going to focus on improving my knowledge of front end development (html,css, and Js), but also i will make it more dynamic and use react and typeScript so as to develop cooler projects. I will also try to be much more familiar with UI design so as to better understand my clients needs and requirements.

### Useful resources

In order to do this project in a correct way you need to have a good knowledge of html and pure css and grid and then tailwind and you need to know how to work with alpine js in the project and connect it to css if you want to use js.
